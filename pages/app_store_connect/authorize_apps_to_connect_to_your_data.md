## Authorize Apps to connect to Data Sources

### First Log In

The first time you log in to a new App (or if you haven't logged in for
a while) you will be directed through the familiar App Store log in
procedure.

If the App requires special privileges, you will receive an
**Application Authorization** prompt.

The **Data Read** privilege is granted for individual data-sources. Open
**Choose Data Sources** and select the required data sources.

### Subsequent Log Ins

The App Store remembers which privileges you grant Apps (so you don't
need repeat the above authorization steps every time you log-in).
However, there may be cases where you wish to edit authorization. For
example, a new Data Source becomes available and you want to analyse it
with App Store's Gestalt Trend.

In order to approve an App to access a new Data Source:

1\. Open the App Store <https://appstore.intelligentplant.com>

2\. Navigate to "My Account \> Apps"

3\. Select application to show more detail.

4\. Select required Data Source.

The App can now query the Data.

### Troubleshooting

**App not listed in Authorized Apps page**

You have not authorized the App. Return to the App Store and open the
App from the Home Page.

**Data source is not listed**

The owner of the data source has not approved you to view it. Contact
the data owner directly and request they share their data source (see:
[Share your Data with other App Store
Users](/App_Store_Connect/Share%20your%20Data%20with%20other%20App%20Store%20Users))
