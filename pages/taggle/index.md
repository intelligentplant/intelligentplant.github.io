### Taggle - Intelligentes quaerere...

Taggle® allows engineers to quickly find the tags that they are looking
for with simple English queries. This opens up the use of data analytic
apps to a user group who may not be familiar with instrumentation
nomenclature of plant control systems.

It aligns terms like “PMP, Pump” and “TI-34892, Temperature, Instrument,
Temp” etc.. This is effectively like Google for tag data.

It requires access to raw tag names, NOT an asset structure and it may
negate the need for an asset structure as it effectively and flexibly
builds a structure on the fly, based on the user’s knowledge and needs.
