# User Management

Click on *View App Store users for the organization* in the organization
portal actions to open the user management page. From here, you can
filter and page through the list of users who have registered with the
App Store. Note that this page does not search your own user directory;
it only shows App Store users.

## Viewing User Details

Click on the *Details* button next to any user to view the full details
for that user, including their group memberships, current App Store
credit balance, and the apps that they have been assigned. For example:

**Important:** Regular users cannot see group membership information,
credit balance or assigned apps, except when viewing their own user
accounts.

## Viewing Assigned Apps

Click on *View Assigned Apps* to see the apps that the user is allowed
to sign in to:

App access is controlled via [app safe- and block-list
management](/general/organization_user_and_data_management/app_access_management).

## Locking and Unlocking User Accounts

Administrators can prevent users from signing into the App Store by
locking their account. The do this, click on *Lock the user account* at
the bottom of the user details page. A locked account can be unlocked in
a similar way. An administrator cannot lock or unlock their own account.
