# Managing Incoming Trusts

The incoming trusts page for the organization shows the accepted and
pending incoming trusts:

Rejected trusts are not shown by default, but can be included by
updating the search filters on the page.

## Updating an Incoming Trust

To update an incoming trust request from a 3rd party organization, click
on the *Edit* button next to the entry. This will display the incoming
trust editor:

![Incoming trust
editor](/general/orgs/admin/trusts/incoming/edit-incoming-trust.png)

Using the editor, you can modify the status of the trust request, as
well as setting an optional end date for any approval.

**Important:** Your externally-visible groups will not be visible to the
requesting organization until you have approved the incoming trust
request.

Click *Save Changes* to update the incoming trust:

**Important:** Please note that, if you reject an incoming trust
request, it will be hidden from the incoming trusts list by default.
Subsequent requests from the same 3rd party organization will not appear
in the list. To change the status from rejected to approved, you must
first show rejected trust requests, and then edit the request as
described above.
