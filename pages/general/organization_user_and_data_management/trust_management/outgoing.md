## Creating an Outgoing Trust

**Important:** Before you can create an outgoing trust, you need the App
Store ID of the organization that you want to trust. You can contact the
organization directly to request this ID from them. To request your own
organization ID, please [contact Intelligent
Plant](http://www.intelligentplant.com/contact.html).

To create an outgoing trust, click on the *Add Trust* button. This will
display the outgoing trust editor:

Enter the ID of the organization you want to trust. You can optionally
provide an expiry date for the trust. Click *Create Trust* to save the
changes. The new trust will be added to the list:

Please note that the 3rd party organization can choose whether or not to
accept your trust request, and can apply its own expiry trust expiry
date, which is not visible to your organization.
