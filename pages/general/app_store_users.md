# Welcome to the Industrial App Store

## What is the Industrial App Store?

The Industrial App Store is an online market place of apps and web
services that connect to industry standard data sources.

## Getting Started

The first step is to register with the App Store.

  - Log in to <https://appstore.intelligentplant.com>

## Open an Application

Click on an Application Card to open an application.

You'll be taken through an [Authorization
Process](/app_store_connect/authorize_apps_to_connect_to_your_data).

## Connect to Data

Most apps on the app store require a data source connection.

Demo data sources are available, but your own data is more interesting.
If your organization has App Store Connect installed, contact the App
Store Connect owner to request data access. Or install your own App
Store Connect to share your own data sources\[2\].

## Get Credits

You'll need some credits to spend on apps.

To get some free credits, refer a friend. Log on to the App Store and
click the "Refer a Friend" button.

Alternatively, buy credits from the App Store [Top
Up](https://appstore.intelligentplant.com/Home/Pricing) page.

Finally, if your organization is App Store Connected, they may have a
pool of credits for employee use - in which case, contact the App Store
Connect owner and request credits.

1.  A UPN has the format "username@domain". In most cases, it will be
    the same as your work email address.

2.  If using a workplace computer, check your organization's policy
    before installing data connectivity software
