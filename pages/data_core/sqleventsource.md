# SQL Event Source

## Overview

**SQL Event Source** is a datacore event source for databases. It
provides low-level support to define a database connection and query
that polls for data. It supports SQL Server, OLE DB, ODBC, Oracle,
EntityClient and SQL Server Compact 4.0.

## Event Message Structure

Records from the SQL source are converted to the Data Core Event Message
structure, with columns becoming Event Properties.

## Requirements

### DB Providers

DB Providers must be installed on the server hosting App Store
Connect.  
(The .Net framework includes most key providers. [More

### Read-Only Data Access

The Event Source can connect to a database using windows impersonation
or with credentials explicitly specified in the connection string
(encrypted). However, in both cases, you should only provide an account
with read-only access to the subset of data you are prepared to share.

## Configuration

  - SQL Provider: DB drivers installed on server 
  - Connection String: The connection string for the remote database.
  - SQL Query: The SQL query string to use when requesting events from
    the database.
  - Sleep Period: Interval to rest if no data is returned.

### Example SQL Query

``` SQL

SELECT TOP 50
  [MessageDataID],
  *
  FROM [dbo].[Archiver1_MasterEventLog_Col1_Con1]
  WHERE  MessageDataID > {0}
    ORDER BY MessageDataID
    
```

The SQL Query should look something like the above and include the
following parts:

  - A Top clause so data is queried and returned in batches.
  - The source-data must contain a Primary Key (e.g. "MessageDataID")
  - A Where filter on the source-data primary key with placeholder (e.g.
    WHERE MessageDataID \> {0}). This allows us to pick-up and move on
    to the next batch of data.
