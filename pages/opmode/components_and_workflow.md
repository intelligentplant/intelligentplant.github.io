OpMode consists of 3 main components. Modules,modes and areas.

**Module**: A collection of modes. **Mode**: Mode component can be
defined by 1 or more areas. **Area**: Process PVs bounded by a period of
time which indicate a mode. For better and more precise results you
might want to define multiple areas.
