### Intro to Data Core

Their 340-day mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS) is
twice the length of a normal stay.

Their extended tour is part of an effort to study the effects of
long-duration spaceflight on the body.

#### Installing Data Core

But scientists will gain further insights by comparing Scott Kelly with
his Earthbound identical twin, Mark.

A Soyuz capsule carrying Kelly, Kornienko and Russian crew member Sergey
Volkov parachuted down on to a steppe in

Kazakhstan at 10:26 local time (04:26 GMT).

### Data Sources

The mission is a record for the ISS and will give Cmdr Kelly a tally of
520 cumulative days in space, over four flights.

#### Event Sinks

Cmdr Kelly has also returned rocket (salad) seeds that were taken up to
the orbiting outpost by UK astronaut Tim Peake in December.

They will be distributed to schools to allow pupils to compare their
growth with rocket plants that have stayed on Earth.
