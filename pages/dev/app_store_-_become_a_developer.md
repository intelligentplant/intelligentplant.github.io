Congratulations - you are now registered as a developer with Intelligent
Plant Industrial App Store.

## Step 2: Get Verified

In order to increase confidence in the apps that are published, and at
the request of clients, we have a verification process which allows you
as an app developer to prove that you represent the company whose logo
is used on your app cards.

Any publisher who is not verified will have a 'not verified' stamp on
their logo to ensure that customers are aware where the technology is
coming from.

This means you will have to verify your logo to prevent this stamp being
added when the update happens to the appstore, here are the instructions
on how to do this:''

**1.** Navigate to your application list in developer view by selecting
Developer and clicking the Applications option.

**2.** Click "*Get verified here*" to start the verification process.

**3.** Enter your organisation name and the logo you are using to
publish your apps.

**4.** Hit submit and hold tight, we will get back to you withing 48
hours.

At this point, your verification status will change to "*Pending*". Once
we have completed the verification process and contacted your
organization to confirm the application is legitimate, the "*NOT
VERIFIED*" banner will be removed from your apps.
