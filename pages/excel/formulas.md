# Writing Data Query Formulas

The Excel Query Add-In adds multiple Excel formulas that can be used to
make queries.

The formulas added by the Add-In are Excel array formulas, this means
that the result of the formula occupies multiple cells.

Before entering a formula select the range that the results of the query
should occupy (if you don't know how many results there will be select a
larger area, or a whole column, otherwise the results will be truncated
to fit in the selected range).

Once you have written (or edited) a formula press **Ctrl + Shift +
Enter** to update the effected range, if you forget to do this you will
get a "You can't change part of an array" error from Excel.

If a cell contains "\#VALUE" that means that the query has been sent but
hasn't completed yet. "\#N/A" means that there is no result for that
cell (i.e. the range you selected is larger than the number of returned
data points).

If no data sources are available you will get a "\#N/A" error. You can
authorize data sources by visiting [Authorized
Applications](https://appstore.intelligentplant.com/Security/Apps),
select "Excel Query Add-In" and ensure that the correct data sources are
selected

## Get Available Data Sources

[This

shows how to do data source and tag searches.

You can get the data sources available to the Add-In by using the
"GetDataSources()" formula.

  - Select 2 columns (e.g. A and B)
  - Enter "=GetDataSources()" in the formula bar

This takes no parameters.

Press **Ctrl + Shift + Enter**

This will get a list of data sources. The left column is the human
readable data source name, the right is the "Fully Qualified Name" the
unique identifier for the data source, this is what should be used in
the data source parameter for other queries.

For some data sources the human readable and fully qualified names may
be the same.

## Tag Search

[This

shows how to do data source and tag searches.

You can get the data sources available to the Add-In by using the
"GetTags(...)" formula.

  - Select 3 columns (e.g. A:C)
  - Enter "=GetTags(\<data source name\>, \<tag query\>)" in the formula
    bar

This takes 2 parameters:

1.  The fully qualified name of the data source you would like to query
    (you can get this using the "GetDataSources()" formula)
2.  A search query or filter (e.g. "\*" for all tags or "pmp" for all
    pumps)

Press **Ctrl + Shift + Enter** to enter the formula

This will return a list of tag names, descriptions and units on the
specified data source that match the query.

**Examples**

*=GetTags("My Data Source", "\*")  
\=GetTags(B1, C1)*

If the data source name is in cell B1 and filter in C1. This would
select the first data source if you had a "GetDataSources()" query in
columns A and B.

## Get Snapshot Data

[This

shows how to use the "GetNowValue(...)" formula.

You can get the current value of a tag by using the "GetNowValue(...)"
formula.

It's also possible to have the timestamp and header row added to the
result. If you wish to include these you will need to enter a range the
correct size. There will be an extra column for the timestamps and an
extra row for the header (i.e. to include headers and timestamps select
a 2x2 range, just timestamps would be 2x1, just header would be 1x2 and
just the value would be a single cell).

  - Select a range the correct size (e.g. A1:B2)
  - Enter "=GetNowValue(\<data source name\>, \<tag name\>, \<include
    timestamps\>, \<include headers\>)" in the formula bar

This takes 4 parameters:

1.  The fully qualified name of the data source you would like to query
    (you can get this using the "GetDataSources()" formula)
2.  The name of the tag you want to query
3.  Whether a time stamps column should be included
4.  Whether a header row should be included

Press **Ctrl + Shift + Enter** to enter the formula

This will return the current value of the given tag, with headers and
timestamps as specified.

**Examples**

*=GetNowValue("My Data Source", "Example Tag", false, false)*

Would get the current value of "Example Tag".

*=GetNowValue("My Data Source", "Example Tag", true, true)*

Would get the current value of "Example Tag" with a header row and
timestamp.

## Get Historical Data

[This
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTZDaH9phew&list=PLsVwx5rtV9c0duV5jln2IX9BIMDCCEWrY&index=5)
shows how to use the "GetHistoricalValues(...)" formula.

You can get the historical data by using the "GetHistoricalValues(...)"
formula.

It's also possible to have the timestamp and header row added to the
result. If you wish to include these you will need to enter a range the
correct size. There will be an extra column for the timestamps and an
extra row for the header. The number of rows required for the query will
depend on the start and end dates as well as the interval, for example
for 2 dates 31 days apart with an interval of "1d" there will by 31
points and therefore you'll need to select 31 rows (plus 1 more if
you're including a header).

  - Select a range the correct size (e.g. A1:B31)
  - Enter "=GetHistoricalValues(\<data source name\>, \<tag name\>,
    \<start time\>, \<end time\>, \<interval\>, \<data function\>,
    \<include timestamps\>, \<include headers\>)" in the formula bar 

This takes 8 parameters:

1.  The fully qualified name of the data source you would like to query
    (you can get this using the "GetDataSources()" formula)
2.  The name of the tag you want to query
3.  The start time for the query
4.  The end time for the query
5.  The sample interval, e.g. "1d", "1h"
6.  The data function, one of "Interp", "Plot", "Max", "Min", "Avg" or
    "Raw"
7.  Whether a time stamps column should be included, 
8.  Whether a header row should be included

Press **Ctrl + Shift + Enter** to enter the formula

The start and end times should be an Excel date (e.g. DATE(2018, 01,
01)), a string with a date (e.g. "01/01/2018") or a relative time (e.g.
"\*-10d").

This will return the current value of the given tag, with headers and
timestamps as specified.

**Examples**

*=GetHistoricalValues("My Data Source", "Example Tag", TODAY() - 10,
TODAY(), "1d", "Plot", false, false)* *=GetHistoricalValues("My Data
Source", "Example Tag", "\*-10d", "\*", "1d", "Plot", false, false)*

Both of these would get the historical value of "Example Tag" each day
for the past 10 days, without timestamps or a header row.

*=GetHistoricalValues("My Data Source", "Example Tag", "01/01/2018",
"01/02/2018", "1d", "Plot", false, false)* Both of these would get the
historical value of "Example Tag" for each day in January 2018, without
timestamps or a header row.

## JSON Parsing

Some tags return JSON objects when queried. In order to make these more
useful in Excel the add-in provide the "ParseJson(...)" formula this can
be used to retrieve individual properties from JSON objects.

  - Select a cell
  - Enter "=ParseJson(\<json\>, \<property name\>)" in the formula bar

This takes 2 parameters:

1.  The JSON object
2.  The name of the property you want to extract (optional, if
    unspecified the whole object will be returned)

This will return the value of the specified property in the provided
JSON. If the JSON is invalid then an error will be returned.

To get nested properties apply the ParseJson(...) formula multiple
times. If the value of a property is a nested object then the ParseJson
formula returns the JSON from the inner object, this can then be passed
to the parse JSON object again to get the propeties of the object.

If the property being selected is an array then the formula will return
the result as an Excel array and the formula acts like an array formula
(i.e. you must select an area the size of the array horizotally and then
press Ctrl + Shift + Enter to enter it). Therefore, if the root object
is an arra you can parse it by not providing a property name parameter.

# Tips and Tricks

## Defined Names

You can define a name to make it easier to use the formulas.

1.  Copy the fully qualified name of the data source (see the "Get
    Available Data Sources" section for details) e.g. "My Data Source"
2.  Open the "Formulas" tab
3.  Click "Define Name" in the "Defined Names" section
4.  Enter a meaning full name in the name feel e.g. "DataSource"
5.  Enter the fully qualified name of the data source into the "Referes
    to:" field like this ="\<data source name\>" e.g. ="My Data Source"

You can now use the name you set in place of the data source name in
formulas, e.g. =GetTags("My Data Source", "\*") becomes
=GetTags(DataSource, "\*"). This makes it easier to change the data
source and saves you typing out or copying long data source names, like
those used by App Store connects.

You can also use this for any other parameters in the UI or in fomrulas.

## Formula Wizard

You can more easily enter formulas by using Excel's built in formula
wizard.

1.  Open the "Formulas" tab
2.  Click "Insert Function"
3.  Select "GestaltDataExcel Add-In" from the category drop down, or
    search for the relevant formula
4.  Select a formula from the list
5.  Fill in the prompted function arguments
